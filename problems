1.6 String Compression: Implement a method to perform basic string compression using the counts
of repeated characters. For example, the string aabcccccaaa would become a2b1c5a3. If the
"compressed" string would not become smaller than the original string, your method should return
the original string. You can assume the string has only uppercase and lowercase letters (a - z).

1.7 Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. (an you do this in place?

1.8 Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
column are set to O.

1.9 String Rotation: Assume you have a method isSubst ring which checks if one word is a substring
of another. Given two strings, 51 and 52, write code to check if 52 is a rotation of 51 using only one
call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat").
