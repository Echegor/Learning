1.7 Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. (an you do this in place?

1.8 Zero Matrix: Write an algorithm such that if an element in an MxN matrix is 0, its entire row and
column are set to O.

1.9 String Rotation: Assume you have a method isSubst ring which checks if one word is a substring
of another. Given two strings, 51 and 52, write code to check if 52 is a rotation of 51 using only one
call to isSubstring (e.g., "waterbottle" is a rotation of"erbottlewat").
